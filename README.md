## Problem Statement

India's **7.1 million auto-rickshaw drivers**, part of a **23.7 million gig-worker economy**, remain largely excluded from formal financial growth because they lack affordable guidance and the tools needed to build stability.

### The Three Core Challenges

**Volatile Cashflow**  
Daily earnings fluctuate unpredictably, making traditional budgeting impossible for gig workers who operate on daily income cycles rather than monthly salaries.

**Financial Illiteracy**  
Limited access to financial education and tools designed for their unique earning patterns leaves gig workers vulnerable to poor financial decisions and economic instability.

**No Affordable Financial Advisor**  
Traditional financial advisory services are expensive and designed for salaried individuals, not for workers with daily cashflows and micro-transaction patterns.

---

## Our Solution

**DhanSetu** (धनसेतु - "Bridge to Wealth") gives India's gig workforce a way to understand and manage their finances, turning scattered earning patterns into clear, personalized guidance. From auto-rickshaw drivers to delivery workers, we predict shortfalls, identify risks, and provide tailored suggestions in the user's own language.

### Solution Pillars

**Hyper-Personalized AI Application**  
Advanced machine learning algorithms that adapt to individual earning and spending patterns, providing context-aware financial guidance.

**Financial Advisor**  
AI-powered advisory system that acts as a personal financial coach, accessible 24/7 without the cost of traditional financial services.

**Multilingual Accessibility**  
Support for Hindi and regional languages, ensuring financial guidance is delivered in terms and languages that resonate with users.
